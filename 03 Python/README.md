- `conda update PACKAGENAME` (Update any installed program)
- `conda create --name py35 python=3.5`  (Create a new environment named py35, install Python 3.5)
- WINDOWS: `activate py35`  (Activate the new environment to use it)
- LINUX, macOS: `source activate py35` (Activate the new environment to use it)
- `conda env list`  (Get a list of all my environments, active environment is shown with \*)
- `conda list` (List all packages and versions installed in active environment)
- `conda list --explicit > bio-env.txt`  (Save environment to a text file)
- `conda env remove --name bio-env` (Delete an environment and everything in it) 
- WINDOWS: `deactivate` (Deactivate the current environment)
- macOS, LINUX: `source deactivate` (Deactivate the current environment)
- `conda env create --file bio-env.txt`  (Create environment from a text file)
- Windows: `where python` (Show the locations of all versions of Python that are currently in the path )
- Linux, macOS: `which -a python` (Show the locations of all versions of Python that are currently in the path )
- `python --version` (Show version information for the current active Python)


### METHOD - II (FROM cirtualven PACKAGE)

To install virtual environment : `pip install virtualenv`

- `clear` (To clear the consloe)
- `ls` (list down all files in the diresed location/directory)
- `virtualenv <project_name>` (Creating virtual environment by <Project_name>)
- `virtualenv <project_name> -p python3` (Creating virtual environment by <Project_name> which use Python3 )
- `source` project_name/bin/activate (In Linux to actrivate your Virtual environment)
- `source` project_name/Scripts/activate (In Windows to activate your Virtual Environment)
- `which python` ( Validating your python version)
- `which pip` (validating your **pip** version)
- `pip list`(which pip packages are avaliable)
- `pip install --upgrade pip` ( upgrading your pip)
